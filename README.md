# Editing/Obtaining the project whilst at home
If you're running a windows OS or Mac OS X, obtaining the GitHub desktop
application is probably the best way of accessing the project:
https://desktop.github.com/ .  You may have to add an SSH key to your account
as a security measure - GitHub will tell you if this is the case and how you
can go about doing it.

If you have a computer running a form of GNU/Linux or BSD, you probably know
what you are doing and don't need to read this.

At home you can use the desktop application or the terminal commands, 
whichever is most convenient for you.  At University though you will need to
use the terminal commands so it may be best if you learn how to correctly
perform changes to the project at home so stuff gets done.
